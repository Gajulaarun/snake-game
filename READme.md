Snake Game
The snake game included in this project is a classic implementation of the well-known arcade game. The objective is to control a snake as it moves around the screen, collecting food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake runs into the walls or itself.

Game Features:
Movement: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
Food Collection: Each piece of food the snake eats increases its length and the player's score.
Audio Feedback: The game includes sound effects for collecting food, moving, and when the game is over. Background music plays throughout the game to enhance the experience.
Files Overview:

index.html: The HTML structure for the game.
style.css: The CSS file defining the visual aspects of the game, including the snake and the background.
index.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and scorekeeping.
Images: Several images (bg.jpg, bj.jpg, sn.jpg) are used to style the game background and snake.
Audio: The game includes sound effects (food.mp3, gameover.mp3, move.mp3) and background music (music.mp3) to create an engaging environment.
This game is fully integrated within the main project and can be accessed directly via the index.html file in the snake directory.
